# Orianna
A Java adaptation of the Riot Games League of Legends API (https://developer.riotgames.com/).

Orianna is the sister library to [Cassiopeia](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/cassiopeia) (Python). It's been designed with usability in mind - making sure all the bookkeeping is done right so you can focus on getting the data you need and building your application.

Orianna is licensed under the [MIT License](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/orianna/blob/master/LICENSE.txt).

## Documentation & Examples
Detailed documentation about Orianna is located [here](http://orianna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). The full JavaDoc for Orianna is available [here](http://javadoc.io/doc/com.merakianalytics.orianna/orianna). Examples of using Orianna can be found [here](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/orianna/tree/master/orianna-examples/src/main/java/com/merakianalytics/orianna/examples).

## Features
Orianna is designed to make the lives of Riot API developers as easy as possible. Here are some of the ways we do it:
- An enhanced user interface that makes using the Riot API easy and fun
  - Restructured and renamed API data for maximum clarity
  - Fluent APIs for requesting data
  - Automatic conversion of foreign keys into the objects they specify (e.g player.getChampion() instead of player.getChampionId())
- Rate limits handled automatically with optimal usage of your API key
- Configurable handling of API errors (e.g. automatic retry on 500 errors)
- Built-in automatic caching, ready out of the box
- DataDragon support
- A highly configurable [pipeline](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/datapipelines-java) for requesting and caching Riot API data
  - Allows flexibility in what database(s) you want to use to cache your data
  - Off-the-shelf support for many popular databases under construction [here](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/orianna-datastores)
  - Extensible to seamlessly integrate other data types and APIs, such as the [ChampionGG API](http://api.champion.gg/) (ChampionGG support coming soon!)

## How to get it
Orianna is distributed through the [releases page](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/orianna/releases) and through [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cg%3A%22com.merakianalytics.orianna%22). The easiest way to get it is by using [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) or [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).

### Maven
To add the latest Orianna release version to your maven project, add the dependency to your `pom.xml` dependencies section:
```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.merakianalytics.orianna</groupId>
    <artifactId>orianna</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.3</version>
    <!-- or, for Android: -->
    <artifactId>orianna-android</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.3</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>
```
Or, if you want to get the latest development version, add the [Sonaype Snapshot Repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/) to your `pom.xml` as well:
```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>com.merakianalytics.orianna</groupId>
    <artifactId>orianna</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.4-SNAPSHOT</version>
    <!-- or, for Android: -->
    <artifactId>orianna-android</artifactId>
    <version>3.0.4-SNAPSHOT</version>
  </dependency>
</dependencies>

<repositories>
  <repository>
    <id>snapshots-repo</id>
    <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
    <releases>
      <enabled>false</enabled>
    </releases>
    <snapshots>
      <enabled>true</enabled>
    </snapshots>
  </repository>
</repositories>
```

### Gradle
To add the latest Orianna release version to your gradle project, add the [Maven Central](https://search.maven.org/) repository to your `build.gradle` repositories section, and add the dependency to your build.gradle dependencies section:
```gradle
repositories {
  mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
  compile "com.merakianalytics.orianna:orianna:3.0.3"
  // or, for Android:
  compile "com.merakianalytics.orianna:orianna-android:3.0.3"
}
```
Or, if you want to get the latest development version, add the [Sonaype Snapshot Repository](https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/) to your `build.gradle` instead:
```gradle
repositories {
  maven { url "https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots" }
}

dependencies {
  compile "com.merakianalytics.orianna:orianna:3.0.4-SNAPSHOT"
  // or, for Android:
  compile "com.merakianalytics.orianna:orianna-android:3.0.4-SNAPSHOT"
}
```

### Using the release JAR directly
Grab the latest JAR from the [releases page](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/orianna/releases) and add it to your project dependencies. JARs are provide both with and without Orianna's dependencies included. The `jar-with-dependencies` version will get you up & running faster, but can cause version conflicts if your project has other dependencies.

If you're using the JAR without dependencies inlcuded, Orianna depends on the following libraries which will also need to be added as dependencies:
- [slf4j-api](https://www.slf4j.org/) (version 1.7.25)
- [datapipelines](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/datapipelines-java) (version 1.0.2)
- [hipster4j](http://www.hipster4j.org/) (version 1.0.1)
- [guava](https://github.com/google/guava) (version 20.0)
- [okhttp](http://square.github.io/okhttp/) (version 3.9.1)
- [jackson-databind](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-databind) (version 2.9.4)
- [jackson-dataformat-msgpack](https://github.com/msgpack/msgpack-java) (version 0.8.14)
- [joda-time](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/) (version 2.9.9)
- [jackson-datatype-joda](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-datatype-joda) (version 2.9.3)
- [cache2k](https://cache2k.org/) (version 1.0.2.Final)

## Example
Check out a basic example of Orianna in action. More examples are available [here](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/orianna/tree/master/orianna-examples/src/main/java/com/merakianalytics/orianna/examples).
```java
import com.merakianalytics.orianna.Orianna;
import com.merakianalytics.orianna.types.common.Queue;
import com.merakianalytics.orianna.types.common.Region;
import com.merakianalytics.orianna.types.core.league.League;
import com.merakianalytics.orianna.types.core.staticdata.Champion;
import com.merakianalytics.orianna.types.core.staticdata.Champions;
import com.merakianalytics.orianna.types.core.summoner.Summoner;

public class Example {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Orianna.setRiotAPIKey("YOUR-API-KEY");
        Orianna.setDefaultRegion(Region.NORTH_AMERICA);

        Summoner summoner = Orianna.summonerNamed("FatalElement").get();
        System.out.println(summoner.getName() + " is level " + summoner.getLevel() + " on the " + summoner.getRegion() + " server.");

        Champions champions = Orianna.getChampions();
        Champion randomChampion = champions.get((int)(Math.random() * champions.size()));
        System.out.println("He enjoys playing champions such as " + randomChampion.getName());

        League challengerLeague = Orianna.challengerLeagueInQueue(Queue.RANKED_SOLO_5x5).get();
        Summoner bestNA = challengerLeague.get(0).getSummoner();
        System.out.println("He's not as good as " + bestNA.getName() + " at League, but probably a better Java programmer!");
    }
}
```

## Configuring Orianna
Orianna ships with a [default configuration](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/orianna/blob/master/orianna/src/main/resources/com/merakianalytics/orianna/default-orianna-config.json) designed to get new users going as quickly as possible. However, you may find you want to take advantage of some of the configuration options Orianna supports by replacing that configuration with your own.

Orianna is able to automatically load your Riot API Key from your environment variables on startup. To take advantage of this, set your `RIOT_API_KEY` environment variable to your Riot API Key.

For more complex configuration, just download the [default configuration](https://github.com/meraki-analytics/orianna/blob/master/orianna/src/main/resources/com/merakianalytics/orianna/default-orianna-config.json), make the changes you'd like, and load the new configuration file when your program starts. Documentation describing the full range of configuration options available with Orianna can be found [here](http://orianna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuring-orianna.html).
```java
Orianna.loadConfiguration(new File("/path/to/your/configuration-file.json"));
```
Alternatively, Orianna can automatically load your configuration file on startup if you set your `ORIANNA_CONFIGURATION_PATH` environment variable to the path of your configuration file.
